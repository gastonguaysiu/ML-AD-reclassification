In k-means clustering, the 'elbow method' is a heuristic used to determine the number of clusters. After reducing the number CpG site to better fitting the data to classify AD severity based on methylation profiles, we are left with a subset of CpG site, and as such we are also left with a prottentially different optimum cluster to be used. The elbow graph plots the WSS against the number of clusters, and the 'elbow' point – where the rate of decrease sharply changes – suggests the appropriate number of clusters. A function is called to create this plot for up to 10 clusters. The script involves several steps denoted below. The elbow graph below estimates the optimum number of clusters before refining the CpG sites to a subset.
