In k-means clustering, the 'elbow method' is a heuristic used to determine the number of clusters.  The elbow graph plots the WSS against the number of clusters, and the 'elbow' point – where the rate of decrease sharply changes – suggests the appropriate number of clusters. A function is called to create this plot for up to 10 clusters.After reducing the number CpG sites to fit the data better to classify AD severity based on methylation profiles, we are left with a subset of CpG sites. As such, we are also left with a potentially different number of optimum clusters to be used.
